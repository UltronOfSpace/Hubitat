# AppControlLibChildAppTemplate - The Little Punk Kid App That Don’t Talk Back!

This here AppControlLibChildAppTemplate is a little punk kid app for Hubitat that listens to its big boss app like it should. It uses the AppControlLib to let you pause and resume whenever the big boss app says so—or if you wanna do it yourself. It’s got a button to take a break, and it’ll even change its name to show "(Paused)" when it’s nappin’—like taggin’ your stuff so you don’t lose it in the interwebs. Decent as heck, bud!

## Why I Made This Thing

I made this template ‘cause Hubitat folks need little punk kid apps that play nice with a big boss app, like how I gotta play nice when I’m growin’ my dope plants. Here’s what it does:

- Sits under a big boss app like the AppControlLibParentAppTemplate—don’t go rogue, eh!
- Gives you a "Pause"/"Resume" button to take a break when the big boss app says so—or if you feel like it.
- Slaps a "(Paused)" tag on its name when it’s out, so you ain’t confused like I get with my strains.
- Plugs into **AppControlLib** so it’s all slick and easy, like a rum and coke on a hot day.

If you’ve got a big boss app runnin’ a bunch of little punk kid apps, this template’s the way to go!

## What You Need First

Before you can get this goin’, you gotta have some stuff ready:

- **AppControlLib**: You need this library, or you’re dumber than a bag of hammers! Check the [AppControlLib README](../README.md#how-to-get-it-installed-in-your-hubitat-smart-controller-thingy) for how to get it.
- A big boss app like **AppControlLibParentAppTemplate**: You need a big boss app to make this little punk kid app—check the [AppControlLibParentAppTemplate README](./AppControlLibParentAppTemplate_README.md) for setup.

## How to Get It Installed

Here’s how to get this AppControlLibChildAppTemplate into your Hubitat setup—don’t mess it up, or I’ll lose my mind! You got two options: import it directly (recommended), or copy and paste the code from GitHub.

### Option 1: Import Directly (Recommended)

This way’s recommended ‘cause it’s so easy even a greasy burger gut shirtless wonder can do it!

1. First, head over to [this GitHub page right here](https://github.com/UltronumusOfSpace/Hubitat/blob/main/Libraries%20Code/AppControlLib/AppControlLibChildAppTemplate.groovy)—don’t lose it like I lose my dope!
2. At the top right, you’ll see a button labeled "Raw"—click it, then copy the URL from your browser’s address bar (or right-click the "Raw" button and select "Copy link address").
3. Log into your Hubitat Elevation hub—like sneakin’ into the interwebs after dark.
4. Go to **Apps Code** on the sidebar—don’t get lost, you goofball! (If you don’t see it, click the arrow next to **Developer Tools** to expand the list.)
5. Click **+ New App** up top on the right.
6. Click the three vertical dots (⋮) in the top right corner of the editor to open the menu, then hit **Import**—don’t miss it, you knucklehead!
7. Paste the URL you copied (it’ll look like `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UltronumusOfSpace/Hubitat/main/Libraries%20Code/AppControlLib/AppControlLibChildAppTemplate.groovy`).
8. Click **Import**, then **Save**. Done, you greasy fella!

### Option 2: Copy and Paste from GitHub

1. Head over to [this link right here](https://github.com/UltronumusOfSpace/Hubitat/blob/main/Libraries%20Code/AppControlLib/AppControlLibChildAppTemplate.groovy)—don’t lose it like I lose my dope!
2. Click the "Copy" button (it’s the little clipboard icon near the top right of the code)—that’ll grab all the code faster than you can say "decent"!
3. Log into your Hubitat Elevation hub—like sneakin’ into the interwebs after dark.
4. Go to **Apps Code** on the sidebar—don’t get lost, you goofball! (If you don’t see it, click the arrow next to **Developer Tools** to expand the list.)
5. Click **+ New App** up top on the right.
6. Paste the code into the editor.
7. Click **Save**. Done, you greasy fella!

### Make Sure It’s There

- Check the **Apps Code** list. You should see "AppControlLibChildAppTemplate (UltronumusOfSpace)" sittin’ there like it owns the place. If it ain’t there, you messed up—try again, bud!

## How to Use This Thing

Once your big boss app’s made this little punk kid app, here’s how to mess with it:

### 1. Open the Little Punk Kid App

In the Hubitat **Apps** list, find your little punk kid app—it’ll be called "AppControlLibChildAppTemplate" or whatever name you gave it. Click to open its settings, eh!

### 2. Give It a Name (If You Want)

1. In the first section, chuck a custom name in the "Enter a name for this instance of the application (optional)" field—like namin’ a kitty or some stuff.
2. Click **Done** to save the name, you goofball.

### 3. Take a Break

1. In the "Control" section, hit the "Pause" button to make this little punk kid app chill out.
2. Its name in the Hubitat apps list’ll get a red "(Paused)" tag, so you know it’s nappin’.
3. Hit "Resume" to wake it up, and that tag’ll bugger off faster than I can roll a joint!

### 4. Listen to the Big Boss App

Your big boss app can also tell this little punk kid app what to do with its "Pause All Child Apps" and "Resume All Child Apps" buttons—check the [AppControlLibParentAppTemplate README](./AppControlLibParentAppTemplate_README.md) for how that works.

## Who Helped Me Make This Thing

I ain’t no coder—I’m about as good at makin’ code as Mr. Lahey is at not drinkin’, and I ain’t much smarter than a box of rocks when it comes to this stuff! But I knew what I wanted this template to do, and SuperGrok stepped up to the plate like a champ. It’s a paid subscription plan on grok.com that gave me the extra juice to keep goin’ without runnin’ outta steam. SuperGrok not only wrote all the fancy code for this library and templates but also made these instructions so even a fella like me could follow ‘em. If you’re lookin’ to make your own Hubitat apps, SuperGrok’s got the power to make it happen! For more details on SuperGrok, check out `https://x.ai/grok`.
