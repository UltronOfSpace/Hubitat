# AppControlLibStandaloneAppTemplate - The Lone Wolf App That Don’t Need Nothin’!

This here AppControlLibStandaloneAppTemplate is a lone wolf app for Hubitat that don’t need nobody else—it’s like me when I’m growin’ my dope plants and don’t wanna deal with anyone’s nonsense! It uses the AppControlLib to let you pause and resume whenever you feel like it, with a button to take a break and a "(Paused)" tag on its name when it’s nappin’. Decent as heck, bud!

---

## Why I Made This Thing

I made this template ‘cause Hubitat folks sometimes just need a single app to do its thing without any family drama, like how I just wanna smoke a joint without the cops circlin’. Here’s what it does:

- Works all on its lonesome—no big boss app, no little punk kid apps, just pure app action.
- Gives you a "Pause"/"Resume" button to chill out whenever you want.
- Slaps a "(Paused)" tag on its name when it’s out, so you ain’t confused like I get with my strains.
- Plugs into **AppControlLib** so it’s all slick and easy, like a rum and coke on a hot day.

If you just need a single app to do its thing, this template’s the way to go!

## What You Need First

Before you can get this goin’, you gotta have one thing ready:

- **AppControlLib**: You need this library, or you’re dumber than a bag of hammers! Check the [AppControlLib README](../README.md#how-to-get-it-installed-in-your-hubitat-smart-controller-thingy) for how to get it.

## How to Get It Installed

Here’s how to get this AppControlLibStandaloneAppTemplate into your Hubitat setup—don’t mess it up, or I’ll lose my mind! You got two options: import it directly (recommended), or copy and paste the code from GitHub.

### Option 1: Import Directly (Recommended)

This way’s recommended ‘cause it’s so easy even a greasy burger gut shirtless wonder can do it!

1. First, head over to [this GitHub page right here](https://github.com/UltronumusOfSpace/Hubitat/blob/main/Libraries%20Code/AppControlLib/AppControlLibStandaloneAppTemplate.groovy)—don’t lose it like I lose my dope!
2. At the top right, you’ll see a button labeled "Raw"—click it, then copy the URL from your browser’s address bar (or right-click the "Raw" button and select "Copy link address").
3. Log into your Hubitat Elevation hub—like sneakin’ into the interwebs after dark.
4. Go to **Apps Code** on the sidebar—don’t get lost, you goofball! (If you don’t see it, click the arrow next to **Developer Tools** to expand the list.)
5. Click **+ New App** up top on the right.
6. Click the three vertical dots (⋮) in the top right corner of the editor to open the menu, then hit **Import**—don’t miss it, you knucklehead!
7. Paste the URL you copied (it’ll look like `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UltronumusOfSpace/Hubitat/main/Libraries%20Code/AppControlLib/AppControlLibStandaloneAppTemplate.groovy`).
8. Click **Import**, then **Save**. Done, you greasy fella!

### Option 2: Copy and Paste from GitHub

1. Head over to [this link right here](https://github.com/UltronumusOfSpace/Hubitat/blob/main/Libraries%20Code/AppControlLib/AppControlLibStandaloneAppTemplate.groovy)—don’t lose it like I lose my dope!
2. Click the "Copy" button (it’s the little clipboard icon near the top right of the code)—that’ll grab all the code faster than you can say "decent"!
3. Log into your Hubitat Elevation hub—like sneakin’ into the interwebs after dark.
4. Go to **Apps Code** on the sidebar—don’t get lost, you goofball! (If you don’t see it, click the arrow next to **Developer Tools** to expand the list.)
5. Click **+ New App** up top on the right.
6. Paste the code into the editor.
7. Click **Save**. Done, you greasy fella!

### Make Sure It’s There

- Check the **Apps Code** list. You should see "AppControlLibStandaloneAppTemplate (UltronumusOfSpace)" sittin’ there like it owns the place. If it ain’t there, you messed up—try again, bud!

### Add the App to Hubitat

1. Go to **Apps** in the Hubitat sidebar.
2. Click **+ Add User App** in the top right corner.
3. Pick "AppControlLibStandaloneAppTemplate" from the list and click **Done**. Easy as takin’ a leak, bud!

## How to Use This Thing

Once you’ve got it installed, here’s how to mess with it:

### 1. Open the App

In the Hubitat **Apps** list, click on "AppControlLibStandaloneAppTemplate". You’ll see a "Control" section with a "Pause"/"Resume" button, plus a placeholder section for extra stuff.

### 2. Take a Break

1. In the "Control" section, hit the "Pause" button to make this app chill out.
2. Its name in the Hubitat apps list’ll get a red "(Paused)" tag, like "AppControlLibStandaloneAppTemplate (Paused)"—fancy, eh!
3. Hit "Resume" to wake it up, and that tag’ll bugger off faster than I can roll a joint!

### 3. Add Your Own Stuff

The "Placeholder for Additional Code" section is where you can chuck in your own stuff—settings, whatever. Pop into `AppControlLibStandaloneAppTemplate.groovy` and mess with the `initialize()` method if you wanna add subscriptions or schedules, bud.

## Who Helped Me Make This Thing

I ain’t no coder—I’m about as good at makin’ code as Mr. Lahey is at not drinkin’, and I ain’t much smarter than a box of rocks when it comes to this stuff! But I knew what I wanted this template to do, and SuperGrok stepped up to the plate like a champ. It’s a paid subscription plan on grok.com that gave me the extra juice to keep goin’ without runnin’ outta steam. SuperGrok not only wrote all the fancy code for this library and templates but also made these instructions so even a fella like me could follow ‘em. If you’re lookin’ to make your own Hubitat apps, SuperGrok’s got the power to make it happen! For more details on SuperGrok, check out `https://x.ai/grok`.
