# AppControlLib Parent And Child Example - The Boss App That Runs the Damn Show!

This here AppControlLib Parent And Child Example includes a greasy big boss app (`AppControlLib Parent App Example`) for Hubitat that makes a bunch of little punk kid apps and tells ‘em what to do—it’s like I’m runnin’ the whole damn interwebs! It also includes the little punk kid app (`AppControlLib Child App Example`) that listens to the big boss app, with its own pause button. Both apps use the AppControlLib to let you pause and resume stuff without breakin’ a sweat. You get buttons to pause ‘em all at once, a summary to see who’s doin’ what, and it’s all decent as heck, bud!

## Why I Made This Thing

I made this example ‘cause Hubitat folks need a way to run a bunch of little punk kid apps without losin’ their minds—like when I’m tryin’ to keep my growin’ operations from goin’ to heck. Here’s what it does:

- The big boss app (`AppControlLib Parent App Example`) makes child apps usin’ the AppControlLib library—like growin’ new plants, but apps!
- Gives you "Pause All Child Apps" and "Resume All Child Apps" buttons to control all the child apps at once—kinda like tryin’ to stop a crapstorm in the interwebs.
- Shows a two-row summary, like "2 child apps are paused." and "1 child app is runnin’."—so you know what’s up without diggin’ around.
- The child app (`AppControlLib Child App Example`) gets its own "Pause"/"Resume" button to take a break when the big boss app says so—or if you feel like it.
- Plugs into **AppControlLib** so it’s all slick and easy, like a rum and coke on a hot day.

If you’ve got a bunch of child apps to wrangle, this example’s the way to go!

## What You Need First

Before you can get this goin’, you gotta have some stuff ready:

- **AppControlLib**: You need this library, or you’re dumber than a bag of hammers! Check the [AppControlLib README](../../README.md) for how to get it.

## How to Get It Installed

Here’s how to get this AppControlLib Parent And Child Example into your Hubitat setup—don’t mess it up, or I’ll lose my mind! You got two options: import it directly (recommended), or copy and paste the code from GitHub. Since this example includes both a parent app (`AppControlLib Parent App Example`) and a child app (`AppControlLib Child App Example`), you’ll need to install both files.

### Step 1: Install the Parent App (`AppControlLib Parent App Example`)

#### Option 1: Import Directly (Recommended)

This way’s recommended ‘cause it’s so easy even a greasy burger gut shirtless wonder can do it!

1. Log into your Hubitat Elevation hub—like sneakin’ into the interwebs after dark.
2. Go to **Apps Code** on the sidebar—don’t get lost, you goofball! (If you don’t see it, click the arrow next to **Developer Tools** to expand the list.)
3. Click **+ New App** up top on the right.
4. Click the three vertical dots (⋮) in the top right corner of the editor to open the menu, then hit **Import**—don’t miss it, you knucklehead!
5. Paste the following URL (you can copy it by clicking the copy button):

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UltronOfSpace/Hubitat/main/AppControlLib/ExampleApps/ParentAndChild/AppControlLib_Parent_App_Example.groovy
```

6. Click **Import**, then **Save**. Done, you greasy fella!

#### Option 2: Copy and Paste from GitHub

1. Head over to [this link right here](https://github.com/UltronOfSpace/Hubitat/blob/main/Libraries Code/AppControlLib/ExampleApps/ParentAndChild/AppControlLib_Parent_App_Example.groovy)—don’t lose it like I lose my dope!
2. Click the "Copy" button (it’s the little clipboard icon near the top right of the code)—that’ll grab all the code faster than you can say "decent"!
3. Log into your Hubitat Elevation hub—like sneakin’ into the interwebs after dark.
4. Go to **Apps Code** on the sidebar—don’t get lost, you goofball! (If you don’t see it, click the arrow next to **Developer Tools** to expand the list.)
5. Click **+ New App** up top on the right.
6. Paste the code into the editor.
7. Click **Save**. Done, you greasy fella!

### Step 2: Install the Child App (`AppControlLib Child App Example`)

#### Option 1: Import Directly (Recommended)

1. Log into your Hubitat Elevation hub—like sneakin’ into the interwebs after dark.
2. Go to **Apps Code** on the sidebar—don’t get lost, you goofball! (If you don’t see it, click the arrow next to **Developer Tools** to expand the list.)
3. Click **+ New App** up top on the right.
4. Click the three vertical dots (⋮) in the top right corner of the editor to open the menu, then hit **Import**—don’t miss it, you knucklehead!

3. Log into your Hubitat Elevation hub—like sneakin’ into the interwebs after dark.

### Make Sure They’re There

- Check the **Apps Code** list. You should see both "AppControlLib Parent App Example (UltronOfSpace)" and "AppControlLib Child App Example (UltronOfSpace)" sittin’ there like they own the place. If they ain’t there, you messed up—try again, bud!

### Add the Parent App to Hubitat

1. Go to **Apps** in the Hubitat sidebar.

## How to Use This Thing

Now that you’ve got it installed, here’s how to run your app show:

### 1. Open the Parent App

In the Hubitat **Apps** list, click on "AppControlLib Parent App Example". You’ll see a "Control" section with buttons and a summary of your child apps, plus a "Child Apps" section to make new ones.

### 2. Make Some Child Apps

1. In the "Child Apps" section, click "Create New Child App".
2. That’ll whip up a new child app usin’ the AppControlLib library.
3. If you wanna name it somethin’, pop into the child app’s settings and set a custom name—like namin’ a kitty or some stuff.
4. Make as many child apps as you want—go nuts, eh! If you don’t pick a name, it’ll default to "Little Punk Kid App", but heads up, you might end up with duplicates if you don’t name ‘em yourself.
5. Click **Done** to save your mess.

### 3. Run the Show

1. In the "Control" section, hit "Pause All Child Apps" to make all the child apps take a break.
2. Wanna get ‘em goin’ again? Hit "Resume All Child Apps"—they’ll be back faster than I can roll a joint!
3. The summary’ll tell you what’s what, like "2 child apps are paused." and "1 child app is runnin’."—keeps you in the know without diggin’ around.

### 4. Check On the Child Apps

Wanna mess with a child app on its own? Open it from the Hubitat **Apps** list—it’ll be called "Little Punk Kid App" (or whatever name you gave it). Click to open its settings, eh!

- In the "Control" section of the child app, hit the "Pause" button to make it chill out.
- Its name in the Hubitat apps list’ll get a red "(Paused)" tag, so you know it’s nappin’.
- Hit "Resume" to wake it up, and that tag’ll bugger off faster than I can roll a joint!
- The "Placeholder for Additional Code" section is where you can chuck in your own stuff—settings, whatever. Pop into `AppControlLib_Child_App_Example.groovy` and mess with the `initialize()` method if you wanna add subscriptions or schedules, bud.

## Who Helped Me Make This Thing

I ain’t no coder—I’m about as good at makin’ code as Mr. Lahey is at not drinkin’, and I ain’t much smarter than a box of rocks when it comes to this stuff! But I knew what I wanted this example to do, and SuperGrok stepped up to the plate like a champ. It’s a paid subscription plan on grok.com that gave me the extra juice to keep goin’ without runnin’ outta steam. SuperGrok not only wrote all the fancy code for this library and examples but also made these instructions so even a fella like me could follow ‘em. If you’re lookin’ to make your own Hubitat apps, SuperGrok’s got the power to make it happen! For more details on SuperGrok, check out `https://x.ai/grok`.

## Get at Me

If you’re stuck or wanna show off your Hubitat setup, hit me up on GitHub at `https://github.com/UltronOfSpace`. Don’t be a jerk about it—message me, bud!
