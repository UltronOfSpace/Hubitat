# UltronOfSpace/Hubitat - The Fuckin’ Sweet Hubitat Code Stash

## Yo, What’s Up?

I’m Ultronumus Of Space (UltronOfSpace, yo), and this is my Hubitat repo, packed with my badass code for your smart home shit when I get around to it. I’m an alien tossin’ in drivers, libraries, apps, and whatever else I feel like while I’m not chuggin’ beer or scarfin’ curry. It’s my toolbox for makin’ your crib run smoother than a cold liquor buzz, but only when I ain’t nappin’ shirtless with a burger.

I’m leanin’ on Grok, that wicked smart AI from xAI, to help me crank out this code and readme. Ain’t no shame in havin’ a buddy who’s like a damn computer, right? This repo’s for anyone wantin’ to make their Hubitat setup dope, if I ever get my ass in gear.

## What’s in the Pile?

Here’s what I got, when I remember to give a shit:

- **Drivers**: Code to make your Hubitat gadgets act like they got brains. Lights, switches, sensors—I got drivers for ‘em, probably.
- **Libraries**: Chunks of code I reuse so I ain’t writin’ the same crap twice. Like tape for my apps, if I finish ‘em.
- **Apps**: Sick Hubitat apps to automate your place. Wanna make your lights flash like a party? I’ll get to it when I ain’t drunk.
- **Random Shit**: Extra stuff I throw in—scripts, configs, or whatever my alien brain spits out between beers.

I’ll toss in more when I ain’t feelin’ lazy, so maybe swing by later.

## How to Use This Crap

1. **Snag It**: Clone the repo or grab the files you want. Easier than stealin’ a case of beer.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UltronOfSpace/UltronOfSpace.git
   ```

2. **Jam It in Hubitat**:
   - For **drivers** and **apps**, paste the code into the Hubitat Web Interface under “Drivers Code” or “Apps Code.”
   - For **libraries**, shove ‘em in the “Libraries” section if the driver or app needs ‘em.
   - Check the file comments for setup tips—I write ‘em clear as fuck, when I ain’t half in the bag.

3. **Test It**: Run the code and see if it’s good. If it’s fucked, holler or log an issue. I’ll check it out when I’m not wasted, swear.

## Why I’m Doin’ This

I’m a chill dude at heart, tryin’ to share my techy know-how with you guys when I ain’t sprawled out like a drunk Ricky. Earth’s a crazy-ass place, and I figure makin’ your smart home run sweet is a cool way to say “thanks for not blastin’ my ass outta orbit.” Codin’ keeps me busy when I ain’t downin’ liquor, eatin’ burgers, or whippin’ up a curry.

## Got Shit to Say or Add?

- **Issues**: Somethin’ busted? Log an issue on GitHub, and I’ll give it a look when I ain’t fuckin’ around.
- **Contribute**: Wanna pitch in? Fork the repo, mess with it, and send a pull request. If it’s legit, I’ll throw it in, maybe.
- **Chat**: Hit me up in GitHub discussions or wherever aliens like me chill, if I’m awake.

## Props to Grok
